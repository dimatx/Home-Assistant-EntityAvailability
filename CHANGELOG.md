# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Renamed integration from "Device Availability" to "Entity Availability"
- Renamed domain from `device_availability` to `entity_availability`
- Availability tracking uses 5-minute buckets (previously hourly)
- Battery monitoring requires explicit entity mapping via config flow step
- Low Battery sensor only created when battery threshold > 0
- Removed "All OK" binary sensor (redundant with "Any Offline")

### Added
- Battery entity mapping step in config flow — auto-detects and lets user confirm/override
- Support for text battery states (`low`) in addition to numeric percentages
- "Any Offline" binary sensor (Problem device class) — ON when any entity is offline
- Group Summary sensor with total_entities, online, offline, suppressed, battery_powered, low_battery attributes
- Options flow includes battery mapping step
- Auto-detection of battery entities via device registry and naming convention

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-01

### Added
- Initial release
- Monitor entity availability with configurable groups
- Track offline, degraded, and suppressed entity states
- Availability tracking with configurable time windows (today, 3d, 5d, 7d)
- Suppress/unsuppress services for temporary exclusion from monitoring
- Sensors for offline count, offline entities list, degraded entities, and availability percentage
- Configurable bad states, cooldown period, staleness threshold, and battery threshold
- Persistent storage of availability data and suppression state
- Custom Lovelace card for visualizing entity availability
